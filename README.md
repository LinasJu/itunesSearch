#ItunesSearch
itunesSearch is a Jira plugin to search apple Itunes store for artists and return results via REST API endpoint.

##Installation
First of all, you should have
[atlassian SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassiansdk/downloads/)
installed.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

Full documentation is always available at 
[Introduction to the atlassian plugin SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK)
